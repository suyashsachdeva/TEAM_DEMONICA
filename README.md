# Blood Donation
This is project Blood Donation. The goal of this initiative is to make it easy for people to collect or donate blood.

The demand for blood has increased as the number of people becoming unwell and the population has grown. As a result, many people these days require blood, and many of them are unable to find a donor. This leads to a plethora of problems, such as operation delays, which commonly result in severely ill patients, especially in remote areas.

"Blood Donation" is an Android software that allows individuals with an Android phone and an active internet connection to quickly contact and search for a donor. The app UI is designed to be simple to use, and if the user still has issues, there is an AI voice support bot available to assist them. The purpose of this software is to help those who reside in remote locations.
